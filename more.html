				<p>My journey in the field of Computer Science starts from an Inter-School Computer Science
					Competition
					in Grade 4 at my school. I joined VIT Vellore in 2019 to major in Computer Science and opted for
					a
					specialization in Business
					Systems. This is when my journey started in its true sense. Although C++ was my first language
					and I
					could fluently code in
					it, I started studying Python with the help of Coursera through a course from University of
					Michigan and within one year I went from learning python to coding complex Machine Learning
					applications.</p>
				<p>I invested my time in building my skillset as fast as possible but as efficiently as necessary
					and
					recieved certifications in the following: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Machine Learning with Python</li>
					<li>Data Visualization with Python</li>
					<li>Exploratory Data Analysis with Python</li>
					<li>Python for Data Science and AI</li>
					<li>Databases and SQL for Data Science</li>
					<li>Data Science Methodology</li>
					<li>Open Source Tools for Data Science</li>
					<li>IBM Data Science Professional Certificate</li>
					<li>Fundamentals of AWS for Machine Learning</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Along with these, I significantly invested my time in learning from a diverse set of resources
					from
					various top tier educational institutions like Udacity, Coursera, University of Waterloo,
					University
					of London and industrial institutions like IBM, Amazon etc</p>
				<br>
				<p>Apart from gaining skills, I enjoy participating in hackathons and mentoring fellow developers to
					efficiently build and deploy AI models. I have mentored in the following Hackathons:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Shell Hacks by Florida International University</li>
					<li>Hack The North by University of Waterloo</li>
					<li>Rotathon by Delhi Technological University</li>
				</ul>
				<p>My aim is to build truly intelligent applications and replicate human consciousness, consequently
					contribute to the future of AI.
					I still believe we are yet to see its true potential and we are (at least theoretically) scratching
					the surface of an entire universe in the field of Computing and Mathematics.
